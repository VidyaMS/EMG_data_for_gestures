# EMG_data_for_gestures
Electromyography (EMG) is an electrodiagnostic medicine technique for evaluating and recording the electrical activity produced by skeletal muscles. EMG is performed using an instrument called an electromyograph to produce a record called an electromyogram.(source - wikipedia)

EMG data from 8 sensors, that were attached to a bracelet were collected through Bluetooth technology . The bracelet was worn on forearm and 6 gestures were performed by the user at regular interval .

Analysis consists of identifying the gestures based on sensor input. Different predictive models were used to perform the task and to check for accuracy and Recall values .
